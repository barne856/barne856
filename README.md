I'm a software engineer in St. Paul, Minnesota with a background in civil engineering.
I build systems that process geospatial data at scale, primarily with open source tools. Backend services, cloud infrastructure, spatial databases, LLM integrations. Most of my work involves figuring out how to make large datasets usable, whether that means optimizing queries, building better tooling, or rethinking how people interact with the data in the first place.
