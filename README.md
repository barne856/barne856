# Hello, I'm Brendan

I'm a software engineer based in St. Paul, Minnesota with a background in civil engineering. I enjoy solving complex problems and building tools that make difficult tasks easier.

My work spans from cloud architecture to computational modeling, with a particular interest in bringing engineering domain knowledge into software development. When I'm not coding, I'm exploring new technologies and approaches that might help tackle tomorrow's challenges.
